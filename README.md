## Introduction

This project leverages real-time weather data and historical crop data to recommend crops based on the current and upcoming weather conditions. The system utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the best crop to grow based on features such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and month of the year. 

The goal is to help farmers decide which crops to grow in order to maximize yields by making informed, weather-dependent decisions.
